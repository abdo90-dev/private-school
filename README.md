## SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The system is developed using the Java programming language with the Swing framework for both the back-end and front-end. It connects to an SQLite database to manage the authentication of the administrator and the secretary, and it can save student records and export them to Excel files.

The system has an authentication window where the admin and secretary can log in by specifying their role and entering their credentials. Once the secretary logs in, a new window appears for managing professors, students, classes, etc. The secretary can access teacher information such as names, ages, salaries, etc., and check student payments and lectures for primary, middle, and high school levels. There are also extra lectures, such as Chinese language, that students can opt to learn for additional payments.

The admin has the same capabilities as the secretary but with two additional tasks. The first task, “stock movement,” tracks payments, rents, and salaries. The second task, “actions,” monitors the secretary’s activities, such as updating student and professor information and ensuring timely payments. This system aims to streamline administrative tasks and improve efficiency.
